        <div class="container-fluid">Now for someone actually interesting: Val Undal. One of my two favorite characters I've ever created.</div>
        <div class="container-fluid">Val is a Pathfinder 1st edition character and is a lot of fun both mechanically speaking and lore-wise.</div>
        <div class="container row">
      <div class="col-4">
        <h4 class="container-fluid text-center">Mechanics</h4>
        <div class="container-fluid border border-secondary">Mechanically, she is a regeneration-focused tank in a turn-based system which normally doesn't work well at all. She has a number of abilities that reduce how much damage she takes outright, plus several that work differently. Her main gimmick is Fast Healing, an ability that heals an amount of damage each turn. The neat trick is that it heals both normal damage and nonlethal damage at the same time, so her abilities let her cut the damage she takes into some lethal, some nonlethal. What this does in practice is effectively double her fast healing, meaning she can take a lot more punishment before going down.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-4">
        <h4 class="container-fluid text-center">Lore</h4>
        <div class="border border-primary">
          <div class="container-fluid">Lorewise, Val's got a lot of baggage and trauma behind those tired, angry golden eyes of hers. From losing her entire team to demons to a decade and a half trapped in the Abyss, she has a hatred for demons to rival Doomguy. But despite it all, she only fell as a paladin because she believed she didn't deserve her goddess' honor anymore. Suvivor's guilt and rage over what seemed like a preventable loss broke her will to continue to be a champion of Iomadae. Val never really did anything wrong. She just was the last one standing and couldn't handle the guilt from her hands being stained with the blood of her allies. All she wanted was to join them. To fight and die with honor. But she wasn't allowed to die. Champion, Paladin, paragon or no, Iomadae and others had plans for Val so she was not permitted to die alongside her fellows. Instead, she was granted immense power and fought her way out of the Abyss, slaughtering countless demons and changing herself in the process.</div>
          <div class="container-fluid">Into the fire of the World Wound went a shining crusader, a righteous paladin.</div>
          <div class="container-fluid">Out of the ashes of the Abyss came a raging pheonix, a searing beacon of unbreakable fury.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-4">
        <h4 class="container-fluid text-center">Personality</h4>
        <div class="container-fluid border border-warning">Val is by this point many things, both good and bad. An ex-paladin, a recovering alcoholic, a pessimist, a warrior, as well as someone suffering from depression and recovering from a bout of suicidal ideation. But she's also still a devoted follower of Iomadae, she's selfless, a hard worker, a caring friend, someone who would willingly give their life for those who couldn't protect themselves. Val is many things, but at the end of the day, she is still Lawful Good to the core. She believes in doing the right thing, no matter the cost to herself. Even if she no longer believes herself to be one, Val always has been and likely always will be a champion of good and virtue. She may have fallen far from what she used to be, she may have dark thoughts and shadows jumping at the corners of her vision, but the truth of the matter is she is a good person and does genuinely care about people, despite the harsh and seemingly cold and bitter exterior.</div>
