          <h4>A little about Kiki and these images.</h4>
          <div class="container">Kiki is very special to me. She represents a lot of promise, a lot of possibilities. She is a beacon of hope in dark days as a reminder of what I can accomplish. She's the reason for a lot of who I am, including how I started questioning and coming to terms with my own gender identity. She's carefree, curious and capable. The kind of girl who can see something, decide to do something with it and actually do it. </div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="container">Neither of these images were created by me, but were in fact made by two very good friends. The one who did the one on the left, Tara, I am no longer in contact with unfortunately. But the one who did the one on the right, Cass, I still speak to quite often and even share two TTRPG games with her.</div>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="container">Can you tell which one came first? The answer is in the footer.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="container col-4">
          <img src="Kiki.png" class="img-fluid">

    <!--Well, the one on the right, the one by Cass is significantly older. Tara had at one point asked to see if I had any pictures of Kiki and surprised me with the one on the left as a Christmas present one year.-->

    <!--Also, Kiki's backstory is honestly more convoluted and almost as dark as Val's, she's just handling it better. I just don't want to go into Kiki's trauma too. Suffice to say, she's lost a lot of good people and has a lot of reason to distrust, but somehow hasn't lost that spark of curiosity. Perhaps she hasn't lost quite as much as Val has, certainly not in as traumatic in a way, but she's had more than her fair share of tragedy. It's just a lot more complicated, in depth and involves another character that's not mine, but in fact belongs to the same Cass that did the art of her. There's... a lot of lore on Kiki. A lot. Val has a lot of conceptual lore, but Kiki has a lot more concrete lore.-->
