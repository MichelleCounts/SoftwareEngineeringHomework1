<!--So while it's been a  *HOT* and spicy minute since I've done anything with HTML, a lot of it is like riding a bike.
	I still remember a fair bit, but I don't want to go too crazy and bite off more than I can chew. No boiler plates for this.
	Just clean, basic HTML, JQuery, Bootstrap and whatever else I think I really need to make it work.-->

<!--Didn't ever really end up using the jQuery, but eh? I'll leave it in, why not.-->

	<div class="container-fluid">Well here we are. Little ol' me. My name is Michelle Counts, although many people know me as Kiki online.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I am a 29 year old transwoman*, a student at UMBC, an avid gamer, a massive nerd, ex-NASA employee, and a wanna-be programmer.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I've been in a relationship with the same woman for the last 10 years, although we aren't married yet, we are working on that. </div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I'm left-handed, have one younger sister, I love all kinds of animals but especially cats and dogs.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I'm not much for sports these days, but when I was younger I played defense in lacrosse and practiced HEMA.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I actually had to give up both due to some bad injuries to my ankles from playing goalie. That ball is basically a rock covered in rubber at 90mph.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I spend most of my free time playing video games, playing TTRPGS and listening to music.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I've said before that of my two favorite characters, Kiki and Val, that Kiki is who I wish I was and Val is who I am.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">In a lot of ways this is true, but there's obviously a lot of differences. Despite my wishes, I am not in fact magic.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">Now, I'm not going to talk too much about Kiki. I'm going to show pictures of her, but that's about it.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">Val gets her own about page, and that should speak a lot about me as well as her.</div>

	<!--It really has been years and years since I've done anything like this and wow am I rusty. I remember a lot but there's a lotta holes in my memory, as always.-->

	<!--That being said... CSS and making it pretty was never my forte. I was always a mid/back end webdev at heart, thus the brute-forcing non-breaking spaces.-->

	<!--And yes, this page being bland while the other two have layout, color and images IS in fact intentional.-->

	<!--*Gender identiy is hard. I prefer she/they pronouns, but calling myself a transwoman is easier than "your guess is as good as mine as long as it's not guy". Fair bit cleaner too.-->
