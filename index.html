<!--So while it's been a  *HOT* and spicy minute since I've done anything with HTML, a lot of it is like riding a bike.
	I still remember a fair bit, but I don't want to go too crazy and bite off more than I can chew. No boiler plates for this.
	Just clean, basic HTML, JQuery, Bootstrap and whatever else I think I really need to make it work.-->

<!--Didn't ever really end up using the jQuery, but eh? I'll leave it in, why not.-->

	<div class="container-fluid">Welcome to this website. Hopefully it can provide some insight on myself and some related characters.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">There's a page here for me, plus ones for each of two characters of my own creation that I think help give an insight into who I am as a person.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">Kiki Duverre and Val Undal. Both fully fictional characters, but also both very, very similar to me.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">I've said before that of these two, that Kiki is who I wish I was and Val is who I am.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">In a lot of ways this is true, but there's obviously a lot of differences. Despite my wishes, I am not in fact magic.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">Now, I'm not going to talk too much about Kiki. I'm going to show pictures of her, but that's about it.</div>
	<div class="container-fluid">Val gets her own about page, and that should speak a lot about me as well as her.</div>

	<!--It really has been years and years since I've done anything like this and wow am I rusty. I remember a lot but there's a lotta holes in my memory, as always.-->

	<!--That being said... CSS and making it pretty was never my forte. I was always a mid/back end webdev at heart, thus the brute-forcing non-breaking spaces.-->

	<!--And yes, this page being bland while the other two have layout, color and images IS in fact intentional.-->

	<!--*Gender identiy is hard. I prefer she/they pronouns, but calling myself a transwoman is easier than "your guess is as good as mine as long as it's not guy". Fair bit cleaner too.-->
