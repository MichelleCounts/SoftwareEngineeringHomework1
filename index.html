<!--So while it's been a  *HOT* and spicy minute since I've done anything with HTML, a lot of it is like riding a bike.
	I still remember a fair bit, but I don't want to go too crazy and bite off more than I can chew. No boiler plates for this.
	Just clean, basic HTML, JQuery, Bootstrap and whatever else I think I really need to make it work.-->
